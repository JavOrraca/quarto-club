# Welcome to Quarto Club!

Hi! We started this website to help showcase the many amazing websites that can be created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Feel free to look around and get inspired!

## How to add your site to the club?

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a folder inside of the `/showcase` folder
3. Add an `index.qmd` file to your newly created folder
4. The header of your `index.qmd` file should follow this example (feel free to add as many categories as you see fit):

```{.yaml filename="index.qmd"}
